## Geo-spatial Visualization
\
\

```{r setup,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(ggmap) # package for visualizing the spatial dataset
library(ggplot2)
df1<- read.csv("C:/Users/mahak/us.csv") #reading the data
df2<- read.csv("C:/Users/mahak/statelatlong.csv")#data loaded having lat and lon

library(plyr)

df<-join(df1, df2,type = "inner")

usdata <- get_map(location = "US",zoom =4) #Get the US map
usdatamap<-ggmap(usdata, extent = "device") #Prepare the US Map

usdatamap +
geom_point(aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, size=count),
data = df)+ggtitle("Missing Children in USA")

```
\

**The spatial representation shows the states having the missing children report cases. The size of the circle tells the number of missing cases in each US state. It can be observed that California is the having the highest amount of missing children cases and the second highest is Florida and the least amount of missing report is in Iowa.**
